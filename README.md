Keywords
========
Made it when I was studying and couldn't remember which lecture notes talked about a certain topic.

Reads files in a directory and allows you to search for keywords and phrases - the program will then show you which files
contain those phrases and lets you open them from the GUI.

Supported files:
 - ppt
 - txt
 - pdf
 - doc
